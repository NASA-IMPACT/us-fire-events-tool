# Dark Mode Toggle

## As a
User

## I want
to be able to switch the app’s appearance between light mode and dark mode using a toggle in the header component

## So that
I can reduce eye strain in low-light environments and personalize my viewing experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A toggle switch for dark mode is available in the app’s header component
- [ ] Switching the toggle immediately changes the app’s color scheme between light and dark modes
- [ ] The selected mode persists when I close and reopen the app
- [ ] All major UI components and text remain readable and visually consistent in both modes

## Additional Information
- Business rules:
  * The toggle should be easily accessible from the main settings menu
  * The default mode is light unless the user has previously selected dark mode
- Technical requirements:
  * Use CSS variables or a theming solution to manage color schemes
  * Store the user’s preference in local storage or equivalent persistent storage
