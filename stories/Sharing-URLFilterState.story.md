# URL Filter State Sharing

## As a
User

## I want
to be able to share specific views created by the application's filters in a URL

## So that
I can collaborate with others by sharing my exact filter configurations and enable them to see the same data view I'm looking at

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] When I apply filters to the application, the URL updates to reflect the current filter state
- [ ] When I copy and share the URL with someone, they can open it and see the exact same filtered view
- [ ] The URL contains all relevant filter parameters (time range, region, fire area, duration, FRP, activity status, etc.)
- [ ] When someone opens a shared URL, all filters are automatically applied and the map/data displays the same results
- [ ] The URL remains readable and not excessively long
- [ ] Invalid or outdated filter parameters in the URL are handled gracefully (fallback to defaults)

## Additional Information
- Business rules:
  * URL parameters should be human-readable when possible
  * The sharing feature should work with all existing filter combinations
  * Shared URLs should remain valid over time unless data structure changes significantly
- Technical requirements:
  * Use URL query parameters or hash fragments to encode filter state
  * Implement URL parsing to restore filter state on page load
  * Ensure proper URL encoding for special characters and values
  * Consider URL length limitations for complex filter combinations
