# Requirements Management Rules

## User Story Management Guidelines

- **File Organization**
  - Storage directory: `stories/`
  - File extension: `.story.md`
  - Organize subdirectories by business module
  - Naming format: `[module]-[function].story.md`

- **Story Document Structure**
  ```markdown
  # [Story Title]

  [Role]

  ## I want
  [Desired functionality]

  ## So that
  [Business value achieved]

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - Technical requirements:
    * [Requirement 1]
    * [Requirement 2]

  ## Related Files
  - Feature: [path]
  - API documentation: [path]
  - Prototype design: [path]
  ```

- **Story Development Process**
  * Strictly follow the sequence below:
    1. Create the user story document
    2. Wait for confirmation of the user story and acceptance criteria
    3. Only start writing the Feature file when explicitly requested by the user
    4. Continue with subsequent development steps
  * Do not write the Feature file before the user story is confirmed
  * Do not start writing the Feature file without explicit user request
  * Feature file creation must wait for explicit user instruction

- **Requirement and Feature Association**
  - Each requirement document corresponds to one or more feature files
  - Record the associated feature file path in the requirement document
  - Add a comment in the feature file header referencing the associated requirement document

- **Version Management**
  - Version file naming: `[original file name].v[version number].story.md`
  - Each version file must include:
    * Change description
    * Reason for change
    * Scope of impact
    * Updates to related files

## Best Practices

- **Story Writing**
  - Each story should focus on a complete business value
  - Stories should be small enough to be completed within one iteration
  - Acceptance criteria should be specific and testable
  - Avoid technical implementation details

- **Story Review**
  - Business and development personnel should review together
  - Ensure the story description is clear and complete
  - Validate the reasonableness of the acceptance criteria
  - Assess technical feasibility
  - Only proceed to the next step after the story review is approved

- **Association Management**
  - Update related files in a timely manner
  - Maintain consistency between documents
  - Regularly check the validity of associations
